**Magincia Changes:**

  - Old Magincia [Client <= 6.0.3.1]
  - Magincia Ruins [6.0.4.0 <= Client <= 7.0.13.0]
  - New Magincia [Client >= 7.0.13.1]

**Notes by Shamino:**

Clients after **7.0.24.0** use new file format **.uop**, not more **.mul**, beware of this if you want to add objects or new animations, it may be more difficult or incompatible.

  - For a server pre .UOP i recommend the 7.0.20.0 client, best stable High Seas version.
  - For a server Stygian Abyss i recommend the 7.0.8.2 client, best stable Stygian Abyss version.
  - For a server old school, i recommend 4.0.11c or 2.0.3 client.

Regards!
